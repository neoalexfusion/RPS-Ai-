## Introduction
This project is a fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you can challenge an AI opponent. The AI uses your webcam to recognize your hand gestures in real-time, decides its move, and announces the result through voice feedback. It's a great demonstration of how computer vision and AI can be integrated into a simple yet engaging game.

## Features
- **Real-time Hand Tracking:** Recognizes gestures like rock, paper, and scissors using your webcam.
- **AI Opponent:** The AI randomly selects its move and competes against you.
- **Voice Feedback:** The AI announces the game results using Google Text-to-Speech.
- **Optimized Performance:** Designed to run smoothly with built-in performance enhancements.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV:** For video capture and frame processing.
- **MediaPipe:** For hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS):** For converting text to spoken words.

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neoalexfusion/RPS-Ai-.git
cd RPS-Ai-
```
## Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run the Game
```bash
python hand_tracking.py
```
## Code Walkthrough

## Importing Libraries
```bash
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
import time
import random
from gtts import gTTS
import os
import threading
from playsound import playsound
```
## Setting Up the Camera
```bash
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
```
## Hand Tracking with MediaPipe
```bash
mp_hands = mp.solutions.hands
hands = mp_hands.Hands()
mp_draw = mp.solutions.drawing_utils
```
## Classifying Hand Gestures
```bash
def classify_gesture(landmarks):
    pass
```
## AI Move and Decision Logic
```bash
def ai_move():
    return random.choice(['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'])
```
## AI Voice Feedback
```bash
def speak(text):
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')
    tts.save("response.mp3")
    playsound("response.mp3")
```
## The Main Game Loop
```bash
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
## Conclusion
Thank you for checking out the Rock-Paper-Scissors game with AI and hand tracking. Feel free to explore the code, contribute to the project, or use it as a reference for your own AI and computer vision projects!
